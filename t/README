Self test for the LibWWW-Perl library.

Tests are run by the TEST script, but usually you run tests with "make
test" at the top directory.  Use -v option for verbose tests.  You
might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v base/date.t

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST base

You enable network tests by creating the "net/config.pl" file.  A good
start is to copy the "net/config.pl.dist" file into this location.
For network tests you should also make a link from the cgi-bin
directory of your http server to the "net/cgi-bin" directory.  The
following setup works for my site:

  ln -s `pwd`/net/cgi-bin ~www/cgi-bin/lwp
  cp net/config.pl.dist net/config.pl
  emacs net/config.pl                        # fix if necessary
