This list contains items that we plan to implement in libwww-perl5.
The order of items does not reflect priority.


Implement MDA security

Implement LWP::RobotUA

Make multiple simultaneous requests work.  Make the callback request
interface event driven.

Provide initial credentials so that we don't always have to get a
RC_UNAUTHORIZED response first.

Allow information callback from protocol modules so that the UI can
inform the user of what is going on.  A good start is to pass the $ua
reference on to the protocol->request().

The ftp module should format directory listings as HTML.

The ftp module probably does not work when talking to non-Unix ftp
servers.  We should CWD to the directory first.

The ftp module could imitate basic authorisation when login fails.

Support ACCT in ftp.

Cache previous ftp connections.

Make file://non-localhost invoke the ftp.pm module.

Use Mail::Send to implement LWP::Protocol::mailto.

Formatters should support tables.  The postscript formatter should
inline images.

The HTML::Parse module should make meta information (<HEAD>) easier
to access.  Parse HTML 3.0 markup.

The HTML::Element->asHTML() method should not introduce whitespace
where it was not present before.

HTTP::Date: remove the reason for BUGS section in the documentation.

The request -o processing should check for Content-Encoding as well as
Content-Type.

The request script should optionally consult Mail::Cap for handling of
media types.

The request script should use the callback interface so that it prints
data as it is received.

The mirror script should be able to work recursively.

Make it work on systems where the directory separator is not "/", for
instance with MacPerl.  Fix URI::URL handling of "/" inside path
components.

More autoloading.

More tests

Include more useful programs

Implement a fabulous graphical UA based on Tk !!!!  HotPerl :-)

Fix bugs, it here are any...
