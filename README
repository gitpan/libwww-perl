This is libwww-perl version 5b5, a set of perl modules for WWW Access.

In order to use this library you will need Perl version 5.001e or
better.

See lib/LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts.
You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation
from these files.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Installation of the library is really just to copy the files in the
lib directory to your standard perl library location.  Edit the
configuration section of Makefile.PL to select which programs to
install in addition to the library itself.

The best place to discuss this code is on the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
mailing list.  You can join the mailing list by sending a mail message to
<libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu> with "Subscribe" as subject.
