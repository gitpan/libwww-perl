This is the README file for libwww-perl version 5b6.

libwww-perl is a library of Perl packages which provides a simple and
consistent programming interface (API) to the World-Wide Web.

There are actually two versions of libwww-perl: one for Perl4, and one
for Perl5. Both have a similar architecture, loosely based on the CERN
Library of Common Code.

The Perl4 version is maintained by Roy Fielding, and was the basis for
tools such as MOMSpider. This version and much more information about
its libraries can be found at:

     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/
      ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/

The Perl5 version (this package) is a complete rewrite for Perl5: the
code is organised in Modules, provides an Object Oriented API, is
updated for the latest HTTP and URL specification, and offers some
extended functionality.

The Perl5 version is currently in beta, and the latest version should
always be available from:

     http://www.oslonett.no/home/aas/perl/www/


In order to use this package you will need Perl version 5.001m or
better.

See lib/LWP.pm for details of the library. See ChangeLog for recent
changes.  POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts.
You should be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract documentation
from these files.


You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You can edit the configuration section of Makefile.PL to select which
programs to install in addition to the library itself.  If you don't
want to install any programs at all then make the initial Makefile with:

   perl Makefile.PL -l

Consult t/README for instructions on how to enable the network tests.


The best place to report bugs and discuss this package is on the
<libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu> mailing list.  You can join the mailing list
by sending a message to <libwww-perl-request@ics.uci.edu> with
"Subscribe" as subject.             ^^^^^^^^
